    <p> Racism is the notion that distinct groups of individuals have different behavioral qualities matching to inherited characteristics, and that these groups can be segregated based on race supremacy. Racism is frequently associated with acts of abuse or harassment. It does not, however, have to be violent or scary in nature. Racism can be seen in people's behavior as well as their attitudes. Racism can manifest itself in a variety of ways, including inadvertent offense or hurt caused by jokes or statements, name-calling or verbal abuse, harassment or intimidation, and media or online criticism that inflames antipathy toward certain groups. Racism can lead to physical abuse and violence at its most acute levels. Racism can prevent people from getting services or participating in jobs, education, sports, and other activities, either directly or indirectly. Policies, conditions, or behaviors that disfavor specific groups might also arise on a systemic or institutional level. Unconscious bias and prejudice are common manifestations. Racism serves to perpetuate racial and ethnic disparities in access to power, resources, and opportunities on a systemic level. Inequalities are sometimes justified by the assumption that a certain race or ethnicity is inferior or superior to others.
