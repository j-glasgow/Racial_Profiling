    <p>Racism is the notion that distinct groups of individuals have different behavioral qualities matching to inherited characteristics, and that these groups can be segregated based on race supremacy. Racism is frequently associated with acts of abuse or harassment. It does not, however, have to be violent or scary in nature. Racism can be seen in people's behavior as well as their attitudes.</p>
