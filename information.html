      Racial profiling is when a person is suspected, targeted, or discriminated against based on their ethnicity or religion rather than on individual suspicion. Racial profiling is a form of prejudice against minorities that is frequently based on unfavorable assumptions about the demographic being profiled. Many people connect racial profiling to criminal profiling, however racial profiling is based on stereotypes about race, color, ethnicity, and other factors. Criminal profiling, on the other hand, is based on real behavior or evidence regarding suspected criminal action by someone who fits a precise description.

    <h2>How is Racial Profiling is handled in different countries?</h2>
    <p>
      <li><u><b>United States</b></u> - Racial profiling refers to disproportionate searches of African Americans, Hispanic and Latino Americans, Middle Eastern and South Asians, and other visible minorities in the United States. Racial profiling in the United States, according to sociologist Robert Staples, is "not merely a collection of individual offenses", but rather a systemic issue that dates back to the era of slavery. 
      </li>
      <br></br>
      <li><u><b>Canada</b></u> - Racial profiling claims by visible minorities accusing police of targeting individuals because of their ethnic background are becoming increasingly common in Canada. The Kingston Police Department produced the first racial profiling study in Canada in 2005. The study focused on Kingston, Ontario, a small city with a predominantly white population. According to the research, black individuals are 3.7 times more likely than white people to be pulled over by police, while Asian and White people are less likely to be pulled over than Black people. Several police organizations denounced the report, claiming that additional research like it would make officers more hesitant to stop prominent minorities.</li>
      <br></br>
      <li><u><b>China</b></u>- The Chinese government has been employing facial recognition surveillance technology to track and control Uyghurs, a Muslim minority in China's western province of Xinjiang, by analyzing the physiognomical output of surveillance cameras. The scope of the massive system was revealed in the spring of 2019 by the New York Times, which dubbed it "automated racism." It has merged the face output with people's DNA in research efforts funded by European organizations to build an ethnic profile. The DNA was acquired at the prison camps, which house over one million Uyghurs, as evidenced by data dumps such as the China Cables in November 2019.</li>
      <br></br>
      <li><u><b>Germany</b></u>- German police policy allows officers to pick those who will be asked for identification during spot checks for illegal immigrants based on skin color and "non-German ethnic origin." As a result, it was determined that a person subjected to a spot-check might compare the policy to that of the general public. The prior judgement deeming racial profiling illegal and in breach of anti-discrimination laws was eventually overturned by a higher court. The civil rights group BÃ¼ro zur Umsetzung von Gleichbehandlung distinguishes between criminal profiling, which is legal in Germany, and ethnic profiling, which is not. In Germany, there has been a rise in hate crimes and violence directed at migrant populations. According to the reports, there were more than ten attacks on refugees each day in Germany in 2016. The United Nations took notice of this German research, which claimed that persons of African heritage in Germany face severe discrimination.</li>
      <br></br>
      <li><u><b>United Kingdom</b></u> - Racial tensions have long existed in the United Kingdom. Following the Windrush surge of immigrants from the Caribbean and West Indies after WWII, for example, racial tensions in the country began to flare up. Knife crime has increased in the capital in recent decades, prompting more police stop and search powers. However, there are worries that these powers will lead to discrimination and racial profiling, with statistics revealing that 54 black people were stopped and searched for every 1000 white people, compared to only 6 white people for every 1000.</li>

    <h2>How is Racial Profiling Connected to Driving?</h2>
    <p>
      After accounting for the demographics of the cities and counties those police departments serve, an analysis of data collected by local police departments on millions of traffic stops over the last several years conducted by ABC News in collaboration with ABC-owned stations shows that Black drivers or pedestrians were more likely to be stopped by police than white drivers or pedestrians in several major U.S. cities.
