    <h2>What is Racial Profiling?</h2>
    <p>Racial profiling is when a person is suspected, targeted, or discriminated against based on their ethnicity or religion rather than on individual suspicion. Racial profiling is a form of prejudice against minorities that is frequently based on unfavorable assumptions about the demographic being profiled. Many people connect racial profiling to criminal profiling, however racial profiling is based on stereotypes about race, color, ethnicity, and other factors. Criminal profiling, on the other hand, is based on real behavior or evidence regarding suspected criminal action by someone who fits a precise description.</p>
